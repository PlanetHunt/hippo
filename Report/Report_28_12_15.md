The application now more abstract way to handle JAVA->MATLAB interaction. It can be set to send the whole simulation data to the Matlab interface at the end of the propagation or send them after step is finished with once switch.

### MatlabPushHandler:
To invoke the different Matalb input method the MatlabPushHandler is used. this class inherits from the stephandler class in Orekit.

```java
SensorDataType[] options = { SensorDataType.MAGNETIC_FIELD, SensorDataType.TIMESTAMP, SensorDataType.SUN, SensorDataType.PX};
MatlabPushHandler mph = new MatlabPushHandler(mi, options, true);
```

So the options are the information, that is needed to be sent to Matlab in every step or at the end. It should be a member of the SensorDataType. `mi` is the matlabInterface. The last option for the Matlab push handler is the `atOnce` toggle. This mode can be switched on so Java collects the needed orbital data in a list and iterates the whole list at the last propagation step.

#### SensorDataType
The SensorDataType is an Enum that contains every SensorDataType or propgationData property. The time of the data (array or double), the name of it in Matlab, the function to call it and probably in future the dependency tree is included in this method. The dependency tree probably will be implemented as a parent, child tree.
