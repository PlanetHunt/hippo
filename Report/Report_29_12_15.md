Orekit supports three kinds of propagation, slave, master and the ephemeris generation mode.

### Slave Mode:
When the evolution of the time is rested completely on the hand of the user. This mode is passive. there is no feedbacks and only after the propagation is finished the the method will return the result to the master application.

### Master Mode:
It is used when the user have some functions that should be called after each step of the integration. It is active and done without the a loop. To call it, the user set the final propagation time and starts the propagation with that parameter.

### Ephemeris Generator Mode:
It is used when the user need to randomly access the the orbital state between the initial and end time. And it is not in sequential order. Is saves all the intermediate states, as a result it could be memory intensive for long iteration or high precession orbital simulation.
